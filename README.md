The application is a Spreadsheet.

The 'x' means that the app implements such requirement.

x Save, load, and create a new empty spreadsheet

x Edit cells of the spread

x Cells may contain plain text, numbers (floating point), or expressions

x Expressions should include literal numbers, variables which reference other cells of the spreadsheet, binary operators including *, /, +, and -, the unary operator -, and bracketing.

x You should be able to press a button to recalculate the cells of the spreadsheet (you may wish to make this automatic as an extension)

x You add more operators into the list of possible operators for the expressions.

x You enable cells to be formatted in different ways.

x You enable column widths to be modified.

x You enable cells to be copied (with this you may also add absolute and relative cell referencing within expressions).

o Enable multiple sheets.

x Improve the way recalculation is done.

x Extend the function language so you can perform operations on the worksheet.

o Provide helpful feedback to users when their expressions or functions have syntax error.
